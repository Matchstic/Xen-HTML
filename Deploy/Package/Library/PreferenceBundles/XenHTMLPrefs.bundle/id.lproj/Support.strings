  Make sure to:

  a) Save this file as 'utf8'
  b) Don't miss any " marks at the start or end of each item
  c) Preserve any \n marks - this indicates a new line
  d) Preserve any %d or %s marks - these are used to subtitute numbers etc into your translation
     For example, "%d enabled" will have numbers placed like so: "2 enabled"

  Much of the translation work is already done. Make sure to check *every* line for something that
  is still in English - these lines need updating.
